title: How long will the initial setup take?
sidebar_label: Time indication

The whole initial setup should take around **2.5h**, excluding things that are not influenceable by this guide. E.g. how much files you need to copy, how slow the Ubuntu download is, how long it takes to get a domain, etc.

:::caution
Just as a reminder: It is not recommended to skip anything until the whole initial setup is done, because the sections partly build on each other. So simply read and work through everything starting here! Just so that you know: the initial setup ends [here](./congratulations)
