The following things are not really necessary for a basic setup but I think that those should be the default on any installation. Hence they are included in the Basic Setup section. You are free to skip this section.

This section should take around **8min**, excluding the previewgeneration. It covers:
1. Install previewgenerator
1. Configure the CookieLifetime
1. Enable the Share-folder
1. Disable Workspaces
1. Disable User flows
