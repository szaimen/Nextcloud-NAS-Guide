This is my own approach how I think, you should set up a home server. It is a result of many different solutions I've come through the last years and is to this point the most complete and advanced solution. I call it `Nextcloud-NAS` because it has features that go far beyond what any other Nextcloud solution offers, especially in terms of server and security features. Most NAS devices have features like a built-in backup solution, a built-in SMB-server and much more. And this is exactly what this solution provides. Please note that most of those features are provided by the [Nextcloud-VM](https://github.com/nextcloud/vm) which you will use to set up your server.

Here is a not complete list of things that this guide covers: hardware recommendations, UEFI/Bios configuration, Ubuntu Installation, Nextcloud installation, full disk encryption, TPM2 unlocking, Let's encrypt for getting valid certificates, Automatic Updates, geoblocking to allow access to your server only from specific countries/continents, server mail notifications, disk monitoring and notifications, Fail2Ban to block too much failed login attempts, ClamAV for scanning and detecting your files for malware, a complete backup solution, a way to manage a full fletched SMB-server, Pi-hole as network wide ad-blocker, PiVPN as VPN-server, Vaultwarden as open-source password server, OnlyOffice Documentserver integration for Nextcloud, High-performance backend for Nextcloud Talk and PLEX as media server.
